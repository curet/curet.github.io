MIT COVID-19 Challenge - Mallón
================

In this competition we worked on ways to solve the problem of tracing immune individuals who are more dangerous transmiting COVID-19 than the ones who present symptons, we didn’t create a software or technology, but we worked on the evaluation solutions using preexisting ones.

The first phase was to apply it on offices. By using Wi-Fi technology to do 3D mapping of people, so we could avoid using cameras to record faces, for privacy reason. In the same manner include thermal sensor to detect their temperature when entering the office.

Later for the general population we could approximate the distance of possible positive cases by doing anonymous mobile device tracing by people collaborating to add their information, if someone was positive in certain area then the county or minicipality could act on it make it easier to trace by areas as cases appear.
