## MIT COVID-19 Challenge - Mallón
================

In this competition we work on ways to solve the problem of tracing immune individuals who are more dangerous transmiting COVID-19 that the ones who present symptons, we didn’t create a software or technology, but we worked on the analysis on how to use preexisting ones.

The first phase was to apply it on offices. By using Wi-Fi technology to do 3D mapping of people, so we could avoid have to record faces and maintain their privacy. In the same manner include thermal sensor to detect their temperature when entering the office, we considered was a good start way to do tracing.

Later for the general population we could approximate the distance of possible positive cases by doing anonymous mobile device tracing and people adding their description, if someone was positive in certain area then the county, could act on it and it would be easier to trace by areas as they appear adding the areas a positive people passed by, we could analyze all the possible coming cases.
