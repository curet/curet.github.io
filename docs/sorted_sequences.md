Sorted Sequences
================

This is a simple project for a programming class in C++, where I had to read a file of random numbers, with 10 columns, and organize the numbers using two algorithms, Bubble and Selection sort, calculate the mean and standard deviation and the time it took each algorithm to complete each task.

The original file
