Replicathon 2020 - IQ BIO REU
================
Jos√© C.S. Curet and Vanessa Janet Viveros

In June we participated in a replicathon with the objective to do an analysis and evaluate if two pharmacogenomic experiments are actually replicable using a pharmacogenomic dataset, following some of the important question we were able to answer and our findings.


### Description:

The dataset has 288 unrepeated cellines

|8 CCLE drug concentrations|

|0.0025  |0.008  |0.025  |0.08  |0.25  |0.8  |2.53  |8  

| 32 GDSC drug concentrations|
