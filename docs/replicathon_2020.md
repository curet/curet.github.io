Replicathon 2020 - IQ BIO REU
================
Jos√© C.S. Curet and Vanessa Janet Viveros

In June we participated in a replicathon with the objective to do an analysis and evaluate if two pharmacogenomic experiments are actually replicable using a pharmacogenomic dataset, following some of the important question we were able to answer and our findings.


### Description:

The dataset has 288 unrepeated cellines

| 8 CCLE drug concentrations |
| --- | --- | --- |--- | --- | --- |--- | --- |
| 0.0025 | 0.008 | 0.025 |0.08 | 0.25 | 0.8 |2.53 | 8 |

| 32 GDSC drug concentrations |
